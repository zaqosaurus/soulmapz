# Data Sources & Licenses

**The Soul Survey is a non-commercial project.** It republishes facts that are already public,
each traced to a named source with a retrieval date. Data is removed on request: anyone named
or represented in it, or any rights holder, can ask through the repository's issue tracker (a
dedicated contact method will be added). Non-commercial licenses such as CC-BY-NC are accepted
on that basis.

**Distribution notes:** keep OSM (ODbL), GeoNames (CC-BY), and Laouenan et al. (CC-BY-SA)
attribution visible — the site's About/Sources panel does this. The memory layer's
share-alike term applies to that dataset's derived aggregates. Every staging file ships
with a `.provenance.json` documenting methodology, counts, and caveats.
